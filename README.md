# DNS_practice

This practice has a main DNS server, a secondary DNS server with a zone and reverse zone.

First of all, we create virtual machine with the following features:

|venus| Debian texto venus.sistema.test .102

|tierra| Debian texto tierra.sistema.test .103

and the host's IP is 192.168.57.0/24
